## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection typically found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide and occurring mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. 

Forty percent of the worldâ€™s population (about 3 billion people) live in areas with dengue. Dengue is often a leading cause of illness in these areas. Each year, up to 400 million people are infected. Approximately 100 million of them will get sick from the infection, and 22,000 will die from severe dengue. 70% of the cases occur in Asia.

Singapore experienced the largest dengue outbreak in 2020. The DenV-3 dengue serotype is likely to be the cause, with 35,315 people infected  and 32 deaths .

The ability to accurately forecast the number of people in a given area that will be infected with dengue is of great value to public health officials, physicians, and ultimately anyone at risk of infection. For example, Public health officials will be able to deploy preventive measures within potential danger zones with greater accuracy based on forecasted numbers. More efficient deployment of resources can also conserve resources for other needs.

We would like to help in this global mission to prevent dengue by building an Intelligent Dengue Predictor application. The application will provide early and accurate dengue case forecasts to public health officials. This is achieved by applying Machine learning techniques to find the correlations between weather conditions and the resulting dengue cases.
